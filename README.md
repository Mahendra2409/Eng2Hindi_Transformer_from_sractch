## English to Hindi Translation from sctrach using Transformer

I want to dive deeper into the concepts of `Transformer Attention mechanism`,  `Natural Language Processing`,  `Tokenization`, and `Translation tasks`. 

So I Implemented "[Attention Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762.pdf)" Paper from Scratch.


 I have used [Aarif1430/english-to-hindi](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Aarif1430/english-to-hindi) Dataset from hugging face which has 1.27lakh examples.
